## 🪜 Beginner-Friendly Backtracking Ladder

### 1. [Subset Generation](https://github.com/harikrishnapanicker/LetsLearn/blob/main/BackTracking/SubsetGeneration.java)
👉 *Given an array, return all subsets (power set).*  
Simple recursion & choice-making.

---

### 2. [Permutations of a String or Array](https://github.com/harikrishnapanicker/LetsLearn/blob/main/BackTracking/Permutations.java)
👉 *Return all permutations of `"abc"` or `[1, 2, 3]`.*  
Introduces swapping & `used[]` arrays.

---

### 3. Combination Sum I
👉 *Choose numbers to sum up to a target (with reuse).*  
Helps you manage choices & pruning.

---

### 4. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
👉 *Classic mapping like T9 keypad → generate letter combos.*  
Recursive branching based on digit mapping.

---

### 5. Rat in a Maze
👉 *Move in a 2D grid, find all paths from top-left to bottom-right.*  
Foundation for N-Queens / Maze-solving later.

---

### 6. N-Queens (Finally)
👉 *With confidence from the above, you’ll crack it easily.*
